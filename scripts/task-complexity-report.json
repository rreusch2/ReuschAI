      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the n8n contact form workflow implementation into detailed subtasks covering webhook setup, data validation, Google Sheets integration, and email notification configuration. Include specific steps for testing each component.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves setting up a webhook trigger, configuring data validation, integrating with Google Sheets, and setting up email notifications. The workflow is well-defined with clear steps, but requires understanding of n8n's interface and webhook configuration. The complexity comes from integrating multiple services and implementing proper error handling."

Include specific testing procedures for each component and flow.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating the main Flask endpoint that handles all chatbot interactions. The complexity is high due to the need to manage conversation state, handle lead capture flow, integrate with DeepSeek API, and implement proper error handling. The implementation requires understanding of Flask, API integrations, and conversation flow management."
